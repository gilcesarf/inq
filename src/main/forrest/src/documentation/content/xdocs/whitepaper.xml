      <p class="white">
        <em>The overwhelming popularity of object oriented techniques and
            languages promotes their use in the implementation of business systems
            almost without question. This has led to more than one generation of
            OO frameworks for common services, such as transaction management
            and long-term persistence.</em>

      <p class="white">
        <em>However over the complete life-cycle of design, implementation,
          test/rework and maintenance experience can show the benefits are
          doubtful and some question the consensus [Hickey].</em>

        <em>The theory presented here has been developed into a procedural
          language and execution environment known as Inq.
          In turn, Inq has been used to great effect to develop the Synthetics
          trading system </em>Xylinq<em> [www.xylinq.com]</em>
