<a name="hi"><h1>Hi There</h1></a>
This is an effort to get a JCalendar community (back) together, prompted by
enhancements I have made and then those I found from other users. My changes are
set out below. After that I have summarised what I found in the forums.
<p/>
I did submit my changes, which I think others would find useful, to
the originator of JCalendar, Kai Toedter, but even after a few prods he
remains silent.
<p/>
I have an interest in JCalendar because it is the "gDateChooser" component
in the Inq client/server scripting language. If you want to know more about
that see <a href="http://www.inqwell.com">http://www.inqwell.com</a>.
<p/>
Accordingly I have combined the things I found with my own features and
volunteer to maintain these components. Get in touch if you are
interested: tom dot sanders at inqwell dot com or may be a
board at <a href="http://forums.inqwell.com">forums.inqwell.com</a>.
<p/>
My changes, outlined below, can be found
at <a href="https://github.com/inqwell/jcalendar">https://github.com/inqwell/jcalendar</a>.

<a name="tom"><h1>Tom&#39;s Changes</h1></a>
I&#39;ve put a few enhancements into the JCalendar components. Here goes:
<h2>Components</h2>
<ul><li>The <code>nullText</code> property.<br/>
Sometimes it is nice to display some text in JDateChooser, rather than blank,
when the date is null. For example null might mean "Open Ended" or whatever.
There is a new property on JDateChooser to specify this.
</li>
<li>
The <code>selectOnFocus</code> property.<br/>
When a JDateChooser (that is the underlying JTextComponent) gains the focus,
optionally select its text. Useful for keyboard junkies.
</li>
<li>
The <code>dateVerifier</code> property.<br/>
As well as <code>min/maxSelectableDate</code>, the <code>DateVerifier</code> interface
allows clients to specify arbitrary validation checks, for example valid
business days. When present on JDayChooser, JCalendar or JDateChooser
the <code>valid()</code> method is called. For JDayChooser and JCalendar (and within
JDateChooser obviously) the calendar buttons are disabled for dates that are
not valid. If a JDateChooser has a spinner editor then invalid dates are skipped
in the direction of travel. The same is true for values entered as text.
</li>
<li>
Keyboard interface.<br/>
As far as I am aware, using the mnemonic is limited in that it does not require
the component to have the focus. If you have more than one JDateChooser in
your window Alt+C will only ever apply to the one most recently created. I
have changed this to use the input/action map. When focused in
the underlying JTextComponent, Ctrl-C pops up the calendar and Ctrl-N sets
the value to <code>null</code>.
</li>
<li>
Miscellaneous.<br/>
<code>JDateChooser.lastSelectedDate</code> not used - I removed it.
Similarly <code>isInitialized</code>.<br/><code>IDateEditor</code> exposes the
underlying DateFormat
<br/><code>IDateEditor</code>
provides a method to retrieve the underlying JTextComponent.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Program</h2>
I've added the new properties so they can be exercised. For a <code>DateVerifier</code>
I have implemented one that excludes Mondays and otherwise includes only even
numbered dates. You can set/remove it to see how JCalendar and JDayChooser react.
<p/>
For <code>JDateChooser</code> I have added a check box that sets the top four
choosers to null when checked, today when not. You can set them to <code>null</code>
individually using ctrl-n when they have the focus. Set the <code>nullText</code>
using the text field.
<p/>
Apart from the keyboard behaviour everything should be backwards compatible with 1.3.3.
<h2>TODO (Possibly)</h2>
There are a few more things I am considering - firstly, <code>JDayChooser</code>
colours the "today" button however this is based on a <code>Calendar</code>
instance (JDayChooser.today) that never changes. I think this will go stale
if the application is left open overnight....
<p/>
Secondly, its a question as to what "today" is. It need not be today's date
of course. Your system may have its own idea of what the date it is.
I'll think a bit more about that.
<p/>
Last, may be support a separate format for
acceptable input, eg a short form like ddMM, again for k/b junkies.
<a name="other"><h1>Issues Raised in the Forums</h1></a>
I went through the (relatively) recent posts and came up with this issues list.
You need to be logged into the forums for the links to work so whatever...
<ul>
<li>
<strong>UI and JDateChooser state become inconsistent when invalid text is entered</strong>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.toedter.com/forum/post.php?cat=1&fid=2&pid=95&page=1">http://www.toedter.com/forum/post.php?cat=1&fid=2&pid=95&page=1</a>
<br/>
This is (probably) the same thing as <a href="http://www.toedter.com/forum/post.php?cat=1&fid=3&pid=48&page=1">this post</a>.
I have not considered this issue.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<strong>Memory Leak</strong>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.toedter.com/forum/post.php?cat=1&fid=3&pid=32&page=1">http://www.toedter.com/forum/post.php?cat=1&fid=3&pid=32&page=1</a>
<br/>
Didn't find this myself but obviously very important. The WeakReference fix would be the proposal
together with deprecating the cleanup() method.
<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Month Browsing</strong>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.toedter.com/forum/post.php?cat=1&fid=2&pid=102&page=1">http://www.toedter.com/forum/post.php?cat=1&fid=2&pid=102&page=1</a>

No code supplied. Talk about not creating the member jcalendar unless/until it is required.
Have not looked at this myself.
